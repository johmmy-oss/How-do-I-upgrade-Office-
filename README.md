There are two ways by which you can easily upgrade the office. One is for the one-time purchase and the other is for the Microsoft 365 Family/Personal. If you have a Microsoft 365 installed than you donâ€™t need to upgrade your office because you already have the most current version of Office and in near future, you will continue to receive the updates with no additional cost but if you are using a one-time purchase office you can upgrade that to any other product depending on the requirement and can easily download the office setup fr with the help of your product key.office.com/setup
